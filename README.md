# LittleRuby
A small proof of concept inventory management in Ruby on Rails, SQLite, and Chart.js

ToDo:  </br>
[X] Github, make it public </br>
[x] Install Ruby on Rails  </br>
[x] Install SQLlite  </br>
[ ] Install Chart.js  </br>
  Working on this one. It either needs a bundler like WebPacker or something of the genre. Documentation is a bit fuzzy and there are multiple gems. Almost getting there. </br>
[ ] Create Ruby Project  </br>
[ ] Code Inventory Logic  </br>
[ ] Create Inventory Form  </br>
[ ] Data Persistence (View/IndexView)  </br>
[ ] Chart.js configuration?  </br>
[ ] Integrate Chart.js to data persistence?  </br>
[ ] Deploy to Vercel  </br>
